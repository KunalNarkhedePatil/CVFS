Iâ€™ve been working on an exciting project to create a Virtual File System (VFS) using C++. This project utilizes dynamic link libraries (DLLs) to handle essential file operations, such as creating, opening, reading, writing, and managing files through a command-line interface. By implementing essential system calls such as Open, Close, Read, Write, Lseek, Create, and RM, the VFS effectively mimics traditional file handling for a seamless user experience. I designed a modular structure that encapsulates core functionalities within the DLL, promoting code reuse and efficient memory management. To organize and manage data effectively, I utilized linked lists and arrays, which significantly improved the overall performance and functionality of the system. .This project has improved my C++ skills and helped me understand file systems and dynamic libraries better..
